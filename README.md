# Layers-properties-export-script

Layers-properties-export-script is a Photoshop :paintbrush: script for exporting layers properties (position and size) and saving them into Nanits Composer's config file of desired comic book project.

## Installation
Copy NanitsScript.jsx and json2.js to this folder: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2019\Presets\Scripts`

## Usage
After running this script and selecting right `config.json` of correct project, all layers properties are added to `config.json`. That means you don't have to place parallax layers into Nanits Composer manually. You only need to put layers exported as PNG images into `par\img` folder of your project. 

Script doesn't export layers into files. For this I recommend [Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast](https://github.com/hsw107/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast)
